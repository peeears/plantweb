              The plant was cultivated in Yemen around 1000 AD, and later it spread around the world. It’s a widespread plant - but not literally: the bushes are regularly pruned because smaller plants are easier to harvest. Some 33 species can be found in Africa, 14 species in Madagascar and 3 species in South-East Asia and Mauritius. Arabica is the most flavoursome coffee variety and is used for no less than three-quarters of total global coffee production. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-10-aa.png" alt="images/img-10-aa.png" />

              Popular since Victorian times, this was a plant commonly found growing in home Parlors (and that&#39;s how it got its common name). The Parlor was often considered the best room in the house and somewhere important guests would be entertained. Looking back it makes perfect sense that the Victorian&#39;s would only try and grow the most hardy and robust looking plants. For minimal care and effort they&#39;d be rewarded with a room enhancing plant. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-12-aa.jpg" alt="images/img-12-aa.jpg" />

              The first European known to have sighted Norfolk Island was Captain James Cook. In 1774, on his second voyage to the South Pacific in HMS Resolution, Cook noted the presence of large forests of tall, straight trees that appeared to be suitable for use as masts and yards for sailing ships. However, when the island was occupied in 1788 by convicts transported from Britain, it was found that Norfolk Island pine trees were not resilient enough for those uses and the industry was abandoned <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-16-aa.jpg" alt="images/img-16-aa.jpg" />

              As a popular foliage houseplant, A. elatior became popular in late Victorian Britain and was so common that it became a &quot;symbol of dull middle-class respectability&quot;. As such, it was central to George Orwell&#39;s novel Keep the Aspidistra Flying, as a symbol of the need of the middle class to maintain respectability according to Gordon Comstock, the novel&#39;s protagonist. It was further immortalised in the 1938 song &quot;The Biggest Aspidistra in the World&quot;, which, as sung by Gracie Fields, became a popular wartime classic. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-18-aa.jpg" alt="images/img-18-aa.jpg" />

               Pilea peperomioides is native to Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southern China. Here it grows on shady, damp rocks in forests at altitudes from 1500 to 3000m. It is very rare and possibly endangered in its native habitat. However, it is kept in China and worldwide as an ornamental plant. It is one of the easiest houseplants to grow, and can be easily propagated to share with friends, but until recently these plants have not been widely available commercially. Pilea Peperomioides was long a mystery to horticulturists, who couldn&#39;t determine what kind of plant it was or from where it had originated. It was later discovered the plant is native to the Yunnan province in southern China, and was brought to Scandinavia by a missionary who shared cuttings of the plant with friends and neighbors, which explains its ubiquity in Scandinavian homes. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-20-aa" alt="images/img-20-aa" />

              In feng shui, monstera plants represent growth, upward energy, and abundance. They are typically placed in the work or financial corners of a home’s Bagua map or in offices to attract the energy of professional and financial growth. Placed in any corner of the Bagua map, however, monstera plants can attract growth and energy. So, they can be used to invigorate your family life, health, or romantic relationships, too. It’s imperative, however, to place a monstera plant in a location where it has plenty of room to grow. Otherwise, this positive energy could become stifled, blocked, and a force of negativity. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-22-aa" alt="images/img-22-aa" />

In fact, Navajos used the yucca root as a soap, pounding the dry roots and whisking them into cold water to create a soapy lather they used to clean clothes, hair and themselves. Yucca suds were also used in Native American rituals involving spiritual cleansing. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-30-aa.jpg" alt="images/img-30-aa.jpg" />

              Chuniophoenix is a genus of palm tree named after Chun Woon-Young, then director of the Botanical Institute, Sun Yat Sen University, Guangzhou. It contains three known species, native to southern China and Vietnam. Chuniophoenix is a member of tribe Chuniophoeniceae, a small group of palms that exhibit great morphological diversity and interesting biogeography. The tribe includes four genera: Chuniophoenix with 3 species in China and Vietnam, Kerriodoxa (monotypic) in Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, Nannorrhops (monotypic) from Arabia to Afghanistan, and Tahina (monotypic) in Madagascar. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-32-aa.jpg" alt="images/img-32-aa.jpg" />

              In the wild Dracaena grows well in Africa and adjacent islands such as Madeira, the Canary Islands, and the Cape Verde Islands, although there are also a couple of species in southern Asia and one in Central America. There are varieties which definitely look like a tree with a trunk, but there are also robust bush shapes. They can reach a ripe old age, and some species develop a very unusual shape in the wild that look positively primeval. The plant has been around in the West since 1752 and has been popular as a houseplant since 1880.  Error: Invalid URL

              The oldest literature on &quot;Lucky Bamboo&quot; that can be found on the Internet today comes from the 1987 &quot;Chinese Flower and Bonsai&quot; magazine. Lucky bamboo was probably introduced into the inland during the reform and opening up. It was soon widely cultivated in the border areas of Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan, and created a group of flower industry households with 10,000 yuan. Go back to the old almanac calendar, the literature related to horticultural flowers in Europe and the United States shows another story. Plant hunters after the Victorian era collected species that can be kept in gardens all over the world for personal fame and fortune, and at the same time refreshed the Western scientific community&#39;s understanding of nature, and endless new species were named. Today, Kew&#39;s botanical catalogue shows that both possible scientific names for Lucky Bamboo were published in 1892. Error: Invalid URL

              Nowadays, we associate the fiddle leaf fig with a trendy houseplant for urban apartments. But behind the fashionista appearance lies a dark past in the wild. The Ficus lyrata is what is known as a banyan fig tree (Ficus subgenus Urostigima). Instead of growing by itself, it grows from the top of the crown of another tree. Talk about invading personal space. The seeds of the fiddle leaf fig tree land as right at the top of another tree competing for sunlight in the rainforest. By picking a spot so high up, the fiddle leaf fig tree gains access to high levels of sunlight. After this, as the seed of the plant germinates, the roots of the fiddle leaf fig begin to wrap around the trunk of the other tree. This kind of plant is known as an epiphyte. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-40-aa.jpg" alt="images/img-40-aa.jpg" />

              English Ivy was used for holiday decorations, especially Christmas, since the Ancient Roman times. The plant was associated initially with Bacchus, the Roman god of agriculture, revelry and good times. The English Ivy was first introduced by the European colonists in 1727. To the Ancient Greeks, the Hedera helix is an emblem of the muse of comedy, Thalia. Moreover, the Dionysian priestesses, during sacrificial rites, were known to carry staves that were entwined with Ivy. In ancient times, the leaves and berries of the Ivy plant were consumed orally to treat bronchitis and cough. In the year 1597, John Gerard, the British herbalist, recommended to infuse ivy leaves with water and to use it as a wash for watering or sore eyes. <img class="image__inline" src="images/img-44-aa.webp" alt="images/img-44-aa.webp" />
